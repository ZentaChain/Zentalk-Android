# Zentalk Android

Zentalk is a highly secure hybrid encryption, decentralized and peer-to-peer messenger app. Next to great usability, under the hood, youâ€™ll find state-of-the-art encryption with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA and El-Gamal security. Zentalk is decentralized, it has no server point. Zentachain guarantees full anonymity and offline communication between the sender and the receiver using Zentanodes, inclusive hashing function Blake2 and the Tor-network.

Zentalk Mobile App Beta Version will not be fully open-source until a stable version is published. Thanks for your understanding, we try to make the most of our products open-source. This project is under active development, there may be breaking changes.
