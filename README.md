# Zentalk Android

Zentalk is a highly secure hybrid encryption, decentralized and peer-to-peer messenger app. Next to great usability, under the hood, youâ€™ll find state-of-the-art encryption with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA and El-Gamal security. 

Zentalk guarantees full anonymity and offline communication between the sender and the receiver using [Zentanodes](https://github.com/ZentaChain/Zentanode), including the Tor-network protocol.

Zentalk Mobile App Beta Version will not be fully open-source until the stable version is published. Thanks for your understanding, we try to make the most of our products open-source.
